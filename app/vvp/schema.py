"""Static schema SAID registry for VVP credential types.

Maps well-known vLEI credential types to their governance-approved
schema SAIDs.  The verifier uses this registry to determine the
credential type from a schema SAID encountered in an ACDC, and to
validate that the SAID is recognized.

Credential types whose SAID sets are empty (``frozenset()``) are
"pending governance" — the type is known to the system but no SAIDs
have been ratified yet.  ``is_known_schema`` returns ``True`` for
these types regardless of the SAID presented, allowing forward
compatibility while governance catches up.
