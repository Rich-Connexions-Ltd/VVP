## Code Review: Sprint 31 - ACDC Credential Issuance (Final)

**Verdict:** APPROVED

### Assessment
The integration-gated witness publishing test is present and matches the registry integration pattern. It validates that the anchor IXN publish path returns success for all three witnesses when the stack is running. This addresses the last outstanding finding; the prior anchor retrieval fixes remain in place.

### Remaining Issues (if any)
- None.

### Final Notes
Good to proceed.
